Sublime Text plugin for copying code snippets.

The copy process will left-justify code snippets to minimise whitespace when copy/pasting code. Ideal for producing documentation in markdown or WYSIWYG editor.

Supports copy/paste of multiple regions. Multiple regions are combined into one string joined with a comment (e.g. `# code omitted`, language specific comments supported).
